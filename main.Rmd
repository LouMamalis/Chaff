# **Introduction** 
This is first paper that I found when I looked on Google Scholar for papers about chaffinches [@lachlan2003song]. I then chose this paper by Brumm & Mattias [-@brumm2011song] which was another paper from Google Scholar about singing and chaffinches. 

The male and female birds look very different to each other. The male chaffinch is much more colourful and bright as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:male-chaff-fig). Figure \@ref(fig:female-chaff-fig) the duller, less colourful female chaffinch. 

(ref:male-chaff-fig) This is a nice colourful male chaffinch. By Photo © Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_chaffinch#/media/File:Chaffinch_(#Fringilla_coeleb).jpg

```{r male-chaff-fig, out.height="200px", fig.cap='(ref:male-chaff-fig)'}
knitr::include_graphics("male chaffinch.jpg")
```

(ref:female-chaff-fig) This is a lovely less colourful female chaffinch. By Photo © Wikipedia,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_chaffinch#/media/File:Fulda_Buchfinkweibchen_Juni_2012.JPG

```{r female-chaff-fig, out.height="200px", fig.cap='(ref:female-chaff-fig)'}
knitr::include_graphics("female chaffinch.jpg")
```

# **Methods**
This is the methods section that tells you how we did what we did

# **Results** 

<!-- keep this default set up code chunk -->
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r read in data}
chaff <- read.table("data-raw/chaff.txt", header = T)
```


```{r setup2, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, 
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE,
                      fig.retina = 3)
```

<!-- update the tidyverse package -->
```{r packages}
library('tidyverse')
chaff_tidy <- chaff %>%
  pivot_longer(names_to = "sex",
               values_to = "mass",
               cols = everything())
```

<!-- adding a code chunk to calculate SS(x) of all the mass values -->
```{r sum_sq(chaff_mass)}
sum_sq <- function(chaff_tidy) {
  sum((chaff_tidy - mean(chaff_tidy))^2)
}

```

<!-- two variables defined within the function 
created a dataframe with the column measure in it
measure is a generic -->
```{r column function}
sum_sq <- function(df, measure) {
  df %>% summarise(ss = sum(({{measure}} - mean({{measure}}))^2))
}
sum_sq(chaff_tidy, mass)

# adapt the function to calculate the SS(x) for each sex
# here measure and group are standard and then you can plug in the specific variables
sum_sq <- function(df, measure, group) {
  df %>% group_by({{ group }}) %>% 
    summarise(ss = sum(({{measure}} - mean({{measure}}))^2))
}

sum_sq(chaff_tidy, mass, sex)
```

<!-- here we are calculating the summary data - mean/ sd/ se etc 
creates a new table with the results in
this is not using a function though! this is pipeline-->
```{r summary data}
chaff_summary <- chaff_tidy %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(n = length(mass),
            mean = mean(mass),
            sd = sd(mass),
            se = sd/sqrt(n))
```

<!-- creating a function which will calculate the summary stats for the data 
remember to add ALL the types of brackets () and {} -->
```{r data_summary}
data_summary <- function(df, measure, group) {
  df %>% group_by({{ group }}) %>% 
    summarise(mean = mean(({{measure}})),
              sd = sd(({{measure}})),
              n = n(({{measure}})),
              se = se(({{measure}})))
}
```

<!-- paired t test to see the difference between the mass of the males and females -->
```{r data analysis} 
t.test(data = chaff_tidy, 
       mass ~ sex,
       var.equal = T)
```
